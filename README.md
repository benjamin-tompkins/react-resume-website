# This is HireBenTompkins.com!
Built with React and Material UI and hosted on Vercel, the website can be found [here](https://www.hirebentompkins.com/).

# Background
This was a small side project I decided to do while between jobs. The purpose behind making this website was not necessarily the content and the story, but instead to showcase my experience in React and frontend web design. I was noticing a lot of job applications were requesting code examples or GitHub pages, so I thought this would be a great solution to display to recruiters what I can do. 

Creating this was great practice for me. I had never made a React app from scratch, so it was a great learning opportunity. By creating this app, I gained a better understanding of what goes on under the hood and about the customization and configurations possible when setting up a React app. It was fun being my own tech lead and making decisions on which packages and libraries I should use, setting up a proper linter, and finding the right platform for which to host the site. This was also a good excercise to keep my programming skills sharp while between jobs.

# Future Work
A potential stretch goal for this project is to make the data more dynamic and to allow other people to use my template for their own résumés and stories. I'm thinking I could make a program that the user inputs their résumé along with text and images to go in the "My Story" section, and the output would be the React code for their very own website. I think this would be super useful for non-developers who want a website and want to showcase it in an elegant manner, but don't have the programming experience to do so.
